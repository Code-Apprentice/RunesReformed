What is Malzahar gets insanly OP with AfterShock rune?

The program is coded so you should never have to update it (unless riot does something), it will have the most used runes from champion.gg.


## FAQ

Q. Nothing happens???

A. Make sure you have available rune pages, the program wont auto delete a page if you are at the maximum, so make sure you have a free page available.
