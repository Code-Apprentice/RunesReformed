## Future proof

What is Malzahar gets insanly OP with AfterShock rune?

The program is coded so you should never have to update it (unless riot does something), it will have the most used runes from champion.gg.


## FAQ

Q. Nothing happens???

A. Make sure you have available rune pages, the program wont auto delete a page if you are at the maximum, so make sure you have a free page available.

Q. It crashes when i make a page called why?

A. League is only made to have a few number of characters in the title of a page, try to keep it to a champion name and 1 word e.g "Twisted Fate Mid" and avoid using any special characters such as "#"!"

Q. My rune page doesnt load correctly

A. You might have entered a wrong number e.g making a rune page called "Mundo, 8000, 8000 etc" wont work because league cant set your rune to Precision more than once, you also cant take Press The Attack more than once.
